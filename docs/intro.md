# Introduction to Career Connector API

Access available jobs and job detail information using the Avanti Career Connector API. These API endpoints are publicy accessible and only include information already available on Career Connector.

All endpoints are based on Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and are accessed via HTTPS. The base URL for all requests is the organization’s Career Connector address.

## Leveraging the Career Connector API

Creating an integration requires a developer familiar with leveraging API endpoints to build your integration. If you don’t have an API developer on staff, you can involve a third-party developer.
